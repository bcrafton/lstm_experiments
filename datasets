and reuters ... which is apparently a word dataset. 
or maybe not idk.

boom.
we are looking for NLP 
> basic stuff in NLP.
>> why was that so had to find lol.

didnt realize the application was kinda cool to.

longer we wait for gym, the better i think. just sucks we dont have any food.

so we have our example, but we arnt really sure whats going on here. 
need to read the post i guess.

>>> lets start understanding LSTMs.
so keep scouring for the best keras examples 
want to do this next word prediction 

then we can try speech or w.e.

wow, why did we never try caltech101 ?

this looks great

https://skymind.ai/wiki/open-datasets
> Speech Datasets
> bunch of nice data sets we can use

so we do want to do speech ? 
or we want to do translation ? 
what was the one where we load a ton of text and predict next word ? 
  we did some dumb tutorial with this.
